# PyTorch Odyssey

> A hands-on, personalized deep dive into the world of PyTorch — following the book [Dive into Deep Learning (d2l.ai)](https://d2l.ai/) with my own twist on clarity, code comments, and custom examples.


### What’s Inside

- Cleanly structured Jupyter notebooks for every key concept
- Intuitive, beginner-friendly code with detailed commentary
- Practical and story-driven walkthroughs
- Built for self-learners who want to *understand by doing*

This repository grows as I learn — each notebook represents a chapter of my learning story.

### 📈 Road Ahead

- Activation functions & multilayer perceptrons  
- CNNs & computer vision  
- RNNs & sequence models  
- Real-world mini projects with explainability
