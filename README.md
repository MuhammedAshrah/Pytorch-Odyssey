# PyTorch Odyssey

> A hands-on, personalized deep dive into the world of PyTorch, following the book [Dive into Deep Learning (d2l.ai)](https://d2l.ai/) with my own twist on clarity, code comments, and custom examples.

### Why *PyTorch Odyssey*?

The name *Odyssey* reflects what this repository stands for - a thoughtful, deliberate learning journey through PyTorch.

Instead of rushing through syntax and copying code, this project is built on the idea of understanding concepts deeply by building them from the ground up. It’s not just about reaching the destination, but appreciating the path - the false starts, the debugging, the breakthroughs.

By documenting each step clearly, this repository aims to serve as both a study log and a resource for others who prefer structured, story-like learning.

### What’s Inside

- Cleanly structured notebooks for every key concept
- Intuitive, beginner-friendly code with detailed commentary
- Practical and story-driven walkthroughs
- Built for self-learners who want to *understand by doing*

This repository grows as I learn - each notebook represents a chapter of my learning story.

### 📈 Road Ahead

- Activation functions & multilayer perceptrons  
- CNNs & computer vision  
- RNNs & sequence models  
- Real-world mini projects with explainability
